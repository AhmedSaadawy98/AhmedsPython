I was working as an Installation (work on four projects)and maintenance engineer of continuous emission monitoring systems for environmental instrumentation company.
I'm seeking to get a more stable job and more experience.
Yes, I got eight months of training in an automation company, I was dealing with PLC and classic control systems faults. I was part of the team, we upgraded the textile machine with electronics cards to PLC &HMI and servo system, as a graduation project.
